            <h1><marquee>About Me</marquee></h1>
            <p>I am a passionate and dedicated Network Engineer and Cybersecurity professional based in Nairobi, Kenya. With a knack for solving complex technical challenges and a commitment to excellence, I strive to create secure and efficient network solutions that empower organizations. My curiosity and drive for continuous learning have shaped me into a versatile professional ready to tackle the evolving demands of the tech industry. <strong>With a strong academic foundation in Information Technology and hands-on experience in real-world projects</strong>, I specialize in enterprise network design, firewall configuration, device hardening, vulnerability assessment and incident response. My approach combines deep technical knowledge with a commitment to best practices, ensuring networks are not only efficient but also secure and scalable. I have successfully implemented VLANs, Layer 3 switching, dynamic routing protocols (OSPF/EIGRP), wireless deployments and dual-ISP WAN failovers. I also work extensively with security tools such as <strong>Kali Linux, Nmap, Nessus, Palo Alto Firewall and Cisco ASA Firewall</strong> to protect networks from threats and breaches. Every solution I develop is rooted in clarity, functionality and resilience. I prioritize security, performance and user needs while maintaining professional documentation and accountability. Whether building from the ground up or improving existing systems, I ensure networks align with organizational goals and compliance standards.</p>
